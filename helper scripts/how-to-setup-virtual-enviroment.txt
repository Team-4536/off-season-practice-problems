Open a new terminal with 
Menu --> Terminal --> New Terminal
or
CTRL-SHIFT-~

Make sure you are in the correct directory.  You terminal should looks like this:
PS C:\Repos\off-season-practice-problems> 

Enter the following commands one at a time - contact a mentor 
if they fail or you get any error messages:
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m pip install robotpy
py -m pip install mypy
py -m robotpy --main src sync


Check that python and the venv is setup correct by running:
where.exe python

if the first result is 'C:\repos\off-season-practice-problems\.venv\Scripts\python.exe' 
then it is activated
